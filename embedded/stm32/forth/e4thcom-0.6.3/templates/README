README : e4thcom-0.6.3 Project Directory Templates

In this directory you will find some Project Directory Templates for supported
Target Forth Systems, to be used as an example or as a starting point for your
projects.

Using the templates is not mandatory. You can use any directory as a project
directory, also an empty one.

The templates may come with some source code files (e.g. cross-assembler usage
examples) and with image files for supported targets to make getting started 
a bit easier. 

The copyright for all this belongs to the creators. Please see and respect the
copyright notes in the files and in the related target forth distributions.
