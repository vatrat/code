* projects start in three-letter files
** it seems always.fs and board.fs should usually be copied
** (optionally) core.fs should be created to import libraries
** dev.fs should be created to hold any actual project code
** the flib/ folder should be in the same directory as the project file
*** just a side note, io.fs in flib/ is wonderfully convenient
* devices should be flashed with the modified mecrisp-stellaris binary from jeelabs
** it contains some changes like adding the "init" word
** distributed in jeelabs/embello/explore/1608-forth (along with flib)
*** also distributed standalone at jeelabs/mecrisp-stellaris
** should be installed with stm32loader.py from unofficial mecrisp-stellaris docs
*** Or using folie's !upload command
*** python stm32loader.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -evw ~/path/to/f103-mecrisp-x.x.x.bin
* Folie is needed to upload jeelabs files
** Use the !send command
*** Don't type anything while uploading or it will fail (I think)
** E4thcom breaks on flash erasure commands and can't expand include lines
** version 2.14 is HIGHER than version 2.7
* e4thcom uses require statements
** these have a 32 character limit, which is a problem
*** this is bad for importing libraries, which have lots of folders
*** imports should be handled in forth code with include
**** if I can ever get that set up
** these should be called as #require ../path/to/file.fs
*** or #r ../path/to/file.fs
** you can also call #ls or #ls ../path/to/dir
** so far, I'm not sure how to install e4thcom
*** I just have it in a folder with a script to run it on /dev/ttyUSB0
* Interesting
** suf
